### SecurityConfig.java
```java
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
```

#### Annotations

@Configuration:\
This annotation indicates that the class can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions. The SecurityConfig class will be processed to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans.
Beans\
@Bean:\
This annotation tells Spring that a method annotated with @Bean will return an object that should be registered as a bean in the Spring application context. In this class, the passwordEncoder method is annotated with @Bean.

#### Methods

```java
@Bean
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
}
```
#### Purpose:
This method returns a PasswordEncoder bean, specifically a BCryptPasswordEncoder instance. The PasswordEncoder is used for hashing passwords, which is a critical part of securing user credentials in the application.

Return Type: PasswordEncoder

#### Implementation:
The method returns a new instance of BCryptPasswordEncoder, which implements the PasswordEncoder interface. The BCryptPasswordEncoder is a popular implementation that uses the BCrypt hashing function to encode passwords.

#### Usage:
This bean is used in service classes where password encoding and matching are required. For example, it is used to hash passwords before saving them to the database and to check if an entered password matches the stored hashed password.

#### Summary
The SecurityConfig class is a simple but essential configuration class in a Spring Boot application. By defining a PasswordEncoder bean, it ensures that the application can securely hash and verify passwords using the BCrypt algorithm. This setup is a foundational part of implementing security in the application, particularly for user authentication and data protection.
